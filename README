Data Loading
------------

The graph data is provided in JSON format, the path to be loaded is specified at the end of index.htm.
See the default example in 'data/MA.json' to see how to specify an attributed graph. 


Controls
------------

Initially the D3 force layout can be interactively modified by picking and pulling individual nodes 
and by using the force strength controls in the menu.

Use the 'E' key to freeze the current force layout and compute the underlying TAM. Use the 'E' key 
again to unfreeze and re-energize the layout simulation. While freezed, individual nodes can still 
be repositioned by picking and pulling with the mouse.

Use the 'I' key or the menu switch to activate contour hilighting on mouse-over.

Use the mousewheel to zoom in or zoom out and click-and-drag to pan the viewport.
